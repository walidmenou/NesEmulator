A Simple Nes Emulator
=============


An NES emulator written in C++ for nothing but fun.

Roughly 40-50% of games should work (ie. games that use either no mapper or mappers 1, 2, 3 and experimental support for 4, 7, 66 and 11).




Examples of games that have been tested to run (but NOT limited to):

(USA/Japan or World versions only i.e. NTSC compatible)

* Super Mario Bros.
* Donky Kong and Donkey Kong Jr.
* Legend of Zelda
* Pacman
* Nightmare Elm Street
* Battletoads
* Arch Rivals
* etc...


How To Use
-----------

You need:
* SFML 2.0+ development headers and library
* C++11 compliant compiler
* CMake build system

Compiling is straight forward with cmake, just run cmake on the project directory with CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
and you'll get Makefile or equivalent for your platform, with which you can compile the emulator

For e.g., on Linux/OS X:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/amhndu/SimpleNES
$ cd SimpleNES
$ mkdir build/ && cd build/
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ make -j4    #Replace 4 with however many cores you have to spare
```

Just pass the path to a .nes image like

```
$ ./SimpleNES ~/Games/SuperMarioBros.nes
```
To set size of the window,
```
$ ./SimpleNES -w 600 ~/Games/Contra.nes
```
For supported command line options, try
```
$ ./SimpleNES -h
```
